# neorg-exec

    **PRE-ALPHA** - breaking changes incoming soon. See Planning, below

Code block execution for [neorg](https://github.com/nvim-neorg/neorg),
similar to [Org Mode's 'eval'](https://orgmode.org/manual/Evaluating-Code-Blocks.html)

neorg-exec captures the results of the code block evaluation and inserts them in the norg file,
right after the code block.

The insertion point is after a newline and the â€˜Resultsâ€™ keyword.

neorg-exec creates the â€˜Resultsâ€™ keyword if one is not already there.


This code began with [tamton-aquib's PR](https://github.com/nvim-neorg/neorg/pull/618) -
thanks to @tamton-aquib.

## ðŸ”§ Installation
First, make sure to pull this plugin down. This plugin does not run any code in of itself.
It requires Neorg to load it first:

You can install it through your favorite plugin manager:

  ```lua
  use {
      "nvim-neorg/neorg",
      config = function()
          require('neorg').setup {
              load = {
                  ["core.defaults"] = {},
                  ...
                  ["core.integrations.telescope"] = {}
              },
          }
      end,
      requires = { "nvim-lua/plenary.nvim", "laher/neorg-exec" },

  ```vim
  Plug 'nvim-neorg/neorg' | Plug 'nvim-lua/plenary.nvim' | Plug 'laher/neorg-exec'
  ```

  You can then put this initial configuration in your `init.vim` file:

  ```vim
  lua << EOF
  require('neorg').setup {
    load = {
        ["core.defaults"] = {},
        ...
        ["external.exec"] = {},
    },
  }
  EOF
  ```

  ```lua
  require("lazy").setup({
      {
          "nvim-neorg/neorg",
          opts = {
              load = {
                  ["core.defaults"] = {},
                  ...
                  ["external.exec"] = {},
              },
          },
          dependencies = { { "nvim-lua/plenary.nvim" }, { "laher/neorg-exec" } },
      }
  })
  ```

  </details>


## Usage

Given a norg file containing a code block like this:

```norg
@code bash
 print hello
@end
```

You can `exec` the code block under the cursor with an ex command:

```vim
:Neorg exec cursor
```

`cursor` also works on headings. It will execute all code blocks inside that heading section.

To run all blocks in the file, you can use `buf`

```vim
:Neorg exec buf
```

Or you can bind a key like this


```lua
vim.keymap.set('n', '<localleader>x', ':Neorg exec cursor<CR>', {silent = true}) -- search file
```

_Note: `localleader` is like `leader` but intended more for specific filetypes, but you can use `leader` if you prefer)._

### The result

By default, the result will be written into the buffer, directly below the code tag's `@end` tag:

```norg
#result.start
#result.exit 0 0.01s
@result
hello
@end
```

#### Tags to render the results

Provide some tags to specify how to run the code.

```norg
#exec.name helloworld
#exec.render virtual
@code bash
 print hello norg
@end
```

After running a code block with `virtual` rendering, you can use two other subcommands:

- `materialize` to write the virtual text to the file,
- or `hide` to delete the virtual text.


## Planning

### Some bugs I noticed after importing

- [x] After an invocation fails, there's sometimes an index-out-of-bounds
when you retry.
- Rendering quirks:
  - [x] Results rendering can be a bit unpredictable. Sometimes it gets a bit mangled,
  sometimes it can duplicate the results section.
        - I addressed a lot of the quirks by locating the @result block with treesitter.
  - [ ] Spinner is also a bit funky.
  - [x] `virtual` mode does some weird stuff affecting navigation around the file.
        - seems better now. As good as it can be.

## I'd like to do

- Much of the original PR checklist - see below
- Scheduling:
  - [x] One queue (try plenary.async), one consumer. Single thread executing code.
  - [ ] Usually one session & one process at a time, but support multiple workers for 'session' support a la org-mode
- UI:
  - [x] ~~Render 'virtual lines' into a popup instead of the buffer.~~ Doesn't suit multiple blocks
  - [ ] Maybe spinner could go into the gutter.
  - [x] output handling: 'replace' @result block (instead of 'prepend' another @result block)
- Code block tagging, for indicating _how to run_ the code.
  - Similar to org-mode's tagging for [code block environment](https://orgmode.org/manual/Environment-of-a-Code-Block.html) and [result handling](https://orgmode.org/manual/Results-of-Evaluation.html).
  - Options:
        - [-] ~~Consider tags above code blocks like `#exec cache=5m pwd=.. result.tagtype=@`~~
        - [x] Could instead be individual tags per item <- This is @vhyrro's preference.
        - [-] ~~Or, possibly even merge it into the `@code` line ... `@code bash cache=5m`~~
    - [ ] cli args, env support.
      - [ ] try plenary.job for easy env support. Maybe there are some other benefits too.
    - [ ] Caching - similar to org-mode but with cache timeout (plus the hash in the result block)
    - [x] Named blocks.
    - [ ] Handling options for stderr, etc. Needs thought - do we want nested tags?
    - [ ] Output type? e.g. `json`. Then results could be syntax-hightlighted just like code blocks.
- Results
  - [x] Render in a ranged tag? like `@result\ndone...\n@end`
  (or optionally `|result\n** some norg-formatted output\n|end`)
    - verbatim only, for now. It seems like Macros could fulfil generation of norg markup
      <- @vhyrro's recommendation.
      - [ ] `render=file filename.out`
      - [ ] `render=silent`
      - [ ] What to do about stderr vs stdout? prefixes?
  - [x] Tag with start time? like `#exec.start 2020-01-01T00:11:22.123Z`
  - [ ] Then maybe at the end ... (insert above the @result tag)
    - [x] duration - `#exec.duration_s 1.23s`
    - [x] exit code

- [ ] A way to assess whether a compiler/interpreter is available & feasible.
    e.g. `type -p gcc`. Seems related to cross-platform support.
- [ ] Run multiple blocks at once, within a node, etc. Caching, env variables, macros?
  - [x] whole buffer
  - [x] all blocks under a heading
- [ ] Hopefully, tangle integration.
- [ ] file-level tagging (similar to `@code` block tagging)
- Subcommand changes:
  - [x] rename `view` to `virtual`.
  - [x] Restructure, maybe: `:Neorg exec cursor [normal|virtual]`
    `:Neorg exec buf [normal|virtual]` ... not sure yet how to make this extendable.
  - [x] Cursor mode to support 'all code blocks within current norg object'
- [ ] Macro support:
  - [ ] `.exec.call named-block arg arg`
  - [ ] `.exec.result named-result`
  - [ ] some way to address code blocks across files.
  - [ ] some way to chain things together? IDK if this is a good idea, but maybe
        worth thinking about.
- virtual-mode: keep or not keep?
  - Options:
    - [ ] Keep
      - it's kinda cool.
      - maybe more suitable for some use cases? like literate programming?
      Hard to assess
    - [ ] Not keep
      - memory hungry (we need to keep all the lines in a table aswell as
      the virtual lines).
      - The code is a bit more complicated & stateful because of this.
      - Workflow is a bit non-obvious.
      - we could retain virtual lines for stats? and progress reporting?
- Security:
- Safety options:
  - [ ] don't run multiple without confirm?
  - [ ] chroot jails?
  - [ ] docker-based runners?
  - [ ] memory limits, timeouts, etc?
  - [ ] killing processes?
  - [ ] exec.none (could be the default, maybe)
- Integration with `core.tangle`:
  - [ ] Respect `core.tangle` tags somehow? Or at least follow the naming conventions.
  - [ ] Use `core.tangle` to pre-process code blocks? Is that even feasible?

### Planning - some examples

Some examples of what I think a nice tagged code block + results block
could look like ... feedback welcome.

1. Generating some random output - put it in a verbatim range

```norg
#exec.cache 5m
#exec.pwd=..
#exec.results=replace
@code bash
ls
@end

#exec.start 2020-01-01T00:11:22.123Z hash=0000deadbeef1234
#exec.exit 0 1.23s
@result
dir/
file1.txt
file2.txt
@end
 ```
