# neorg-exec

    **PRE-ALPHA** - breaking changes incoming soon. See Planning, below

Code block execution for [neorg](https://github.com/nvim-neorg/neorg), similar to [Org Mode's 'eval'](https://orgmode.org/manual/Evaluating-Code-Blocks.html)

neorg-exec captures the results of the code block evaluation and inserts them in the norg file, right after the code block.

The insertion point is after a newline and the â€˜Resultsâ€™ keyword.

neorg-exec creates the â€˜Resultsâ€™ keyword if one is not already there.


This code began with [tamton-aquib's PR](https://github.com/nvim-neorg/neorg/pull/618) - thanks to @tamton-aquib.


## Installation

# ðŸ”§ Installation
First, make sure to pull this plugin down. This plugin does not run any code in of itself. It requires Neorg
to load it first:

You can install it through your favorite plugin manager:

  ```lua
  use {
      "nvim-neorg/neorg",
      config = function()
          require('neorg').setup {
              load = {
                  ["core.defaults"] = {},
                  ...
                  ["core.integrations.telescope"] = {}
              },
          }
      end,

  ```vim
  Plug 'nvim-neorg/neorg' | Plug 'nvim-lua/plenary.nvim' | Plug 'laher/neorg-exec'
  ```

  You can then put this initial configuration in your `init.vim` file:

  ```vim
  lua << EOF
  require('neorg').setup {
    load = {
        ["core.defaults"] = {},
        ...
        ["external.exec"] = {},
    },
  }
  EOF
  ```

          opts = {

                  ["external.exec"] = {},

  })
  ```

# Usage

Given a norg file containing a code block like this:

```
@code bash
 print hello
@end
```

You can `exec` the code block under the cursor with an ex command:

```
:Neorg exec cursor
```

Or you can bind a key like this


```lua
vim.keymap.set('n', '<localleader>x', ':Neorg exec cursor<CR>', {silent = true}) -- search file
```

_Note: `localleader` is like `leader` but intended more for specific filetypes, but you can use `leader` if you prefer)._

## The result

By default, the result will be written into the buffer, directly below the code tag's `@end` tag:

```
#result.start
#result.exit 0 0.01s
@result
hello
@end
```

## Tags to render the

Provide some tags to specify how to run the code.

```
#exec.name helloworld
#exec.render virtual
@code bash
 print hello norg
@end
```

After running a code block with `virtual` rendering, you can use two other subcommands:
 * `materialize` to write the virtual text to the file,
 * or `hide` to delete the virtual text.


# Planning

## Some bugs I noticed after importing

 * [x] After an invocation fails, there's sometimes an index-out-of-bounds when you retry.
 * Rendering quirks:
    * [x] Results rendering can be a bit unpredictable. Sometimes it gets a bit mangled, sometimes it can duplicate the results section.
        - I addressed a lot of the quirks by locating the @result block with treesitter.
    * [ ] Spinner is also a bit funky.
    * [x] `virtual` mode does some weird stuff affecting navigation around the file.
        - seems better now. As good as it can be.

## I'd like to do

 * Much of the original PR checklist - see below
 * UI:
    * [x] ~~Render 'virtual lines' into a popup instead of the buffer.~~ Doesn't suit multiple blocks
    * [ ] Maybe spinner could go into the gutter.
    * [ ] output handling: 'replace' @result block (instead of 'prepend' another @result block)
 * Code block tagging, for indicating _how to run_ the code.
    * Similar to org-mode's tagging for [code block environment](https://orgmode.org/manual/Environment-of-a-Code-Block.html) and [result handling](https://orgmode.org/manual/Results-of-Evaluation.html).
    * Options:
        * [ ] ~~Consider tags above code blocks like `#exec cache=5m pwd=.. result.tagtype=@`~~
        * [x] Could instead be individual tags per item <- This is @vhyrro's preference.
        * [ ] ~~Or, possibly even merge it into the `@code` line ... `@code bash cache=5m`~~
    * [ ] cli args, env support.
    * [ ] Caching - similar to org-mode but with cache timeout (plus the hash in the result block)
    * [ ] Named blocks.
    * [ ] Handling options for stderr, etc. Needs thought - do we want nested tags?
    * [ ] Output type? e.g. `json`. Then results could be syntax-hightlighted just like code blocks.
 * Results
    * [x] Render in a ranged tag? like `@result\ndone...\n@end` (or optionally `|result\n** some norg-formatted output\n|end`)
      * verbatim only, for now. It seems like Macros could fulfil generation of norg markup <- @vhyrro's recommendation.
    * [x] Tag with start time? like `#exec.start 2020-01-01T00:11:22.123Z`
    * [ ] Then maybe at the end ... (insert above the @result tag)
      * [x] duration - `#exec.duration_s 1.23s`
      * [ ] exit code
 * [ ] A way to assess whether a compiler/interpreter is available & feasible. e.g. `type -p gcc`. Seems related to cross-platform support.
 * [ ] Run multiple blocks at once, within a node, etc. Caching, env variables, macros?
 * [ ] Hopefully, tangle integration.
 * [ ] file-level tagging (similar to `@code` block tagging)
 * Subcommand changes:
   * [x] rename `view` to `virtual`.
   * [ ] Restructure, maybe: `:Neorg exec block [normal|virtual]` `:Neorg exec buf [normal|virtual]` ... not sure yet how to make this extendable.
 * [ ] Macro support:
    * [ ] `.exec.call named-block arg arg`
    * [ ] `.exec.result named-result`
    * [ ] some way to address code blocks across files
    * [ ] some way to chain things together? IDK if this is a good idea, but maybe worth thinking about.

### Planning - some examples

Some examples of what I think a nice tagged code block + results block could look like ... feedback welcome.

1. Generating some random output - put it in a verbatim range

```norg
#exec.cache 5m
#exec.pwd=..
#exec.results=replace
@code bash
ls
@end

#exec.start 2020-01-01T00:11:22.123Z
#exec.codehash 0000deadbeef1234
#exec.duration 1.23s
#exec.exitcode 0
@result
dir/
file1.txt
file2.txt
@end
 ```

2. Generating some neorg output - put it in a standard range... (@vhyrro not so keen on this, because macros should be able to do something better)

```norg
#exec.cache 24h
#exec.result.tagtype=|
@code bash
./generate-todos-from-gmail.sh
@end

#exec.start time 2020-01-01T00:11:22.123Z
#exec.codehash 0000deadbeef1234
#exec.duration 1.23s
#exec.exitcode 0
|result
*** todos
 - (?) Reply to daily report
 - ( ) Breakfast with Tiffany
 - ( ) Cook the ice-cream
|end
 ```

## 'Possible todos' from original PR

See [https://github.com/nvim-neorg/neorg/pull/618#issue-1402358683](Pull Request)

 * [ ]  cross platform support.
 * [x]  spinner for running block.
 * [ ]  run for
   * [x]  compiled (c, cpp, rust, etc)
     * [ ]  check extra parameters for wrapping in main function? (+ named blocks)
   * [x]  interpreted (python, lua, bash, etc)
 * [x]  subcommands
   * [x]  ~~view~~ (virtual_lines) renamed to `virtual`
   * [x]  normal (maybe a better command name, normal lines added to buffer.)
 * [ ]  add logging?
 * [ ]  check for timeout / limit number of output lines.
 * [x]  make non-blockable if possible (weird python behaviour)
 * [ ]  user config options.
 * [x]  set lines to separate files and run.
 * [x]  panic messages instead of empty returns.
 * [x]  assign state for each running block instead of tracking the current one. (will fix spinners and re-execution bugs)
 * [ ]  code cleanup.
